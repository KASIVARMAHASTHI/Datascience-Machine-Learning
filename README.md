Introduction
The "Tech Layoffs 2019-2023" project aims to understand the factors behind significant workforce reductions in the global technology sector. The goal is to unravel the reasons behind these layoffs, ranging from economic downturns to technological disruptions and strategic transformations within tech companies.

Data
* Sources:
    * Layoffs.fyi
    * TechCrunch
    * Kaggle Dataset
* Description:
    * The dataset includes detailed layoff information within the broader economic context, focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
    * Data collection involved official company reports, reputable news outlets, and government records.
    * Extensive data cleaning and preprocessing were performed to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Methodology
1. Data Cleaning:
    * Handling missing values, addressing outliers, and standardizing data formats.
    
2. Feature Engineering:
    * Creating relevant features for modeling.
  
3. Modeling:
    * Using classification algorithms like decision trees, random forests, and bagging classifiers.
      
4. Evaluation:
    * Assessing model performance using accuracy metrics.

Results
* Layoffs were generally higher in 2020, dropped in 2021, and skyrocketed in 2022.
* The transportation and travel industries were initially affected the most, but recovered later.
* The retail, consumer, and food industries faced a sharp increase in layoffs.
* The United States and India suffered the most layoffs, with the consumer industry in the USA hit hardest in 2022.
* Decision tree and bagging classifiers achieved the highest accuracy (93% and 94% respectively).

Dependencies
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
